# Talkies

This movie application, crafted with Jetpack Compose, boasts a clean architecture that enhances its robustness and maintainability. Seamlessly integrating modern technologies like Paging3 and Room DB, the app efficiently manages data. It follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, providing a structured and scalable codebase.
